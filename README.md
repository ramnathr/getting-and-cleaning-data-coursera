# Course Project

This repository contains a script and codebook to complete the course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data". The script will create a summarized data set when placed in the same directory as the following *extracted* zip file: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To run, open R, navigate to the directory where the data sets and R file are located and source the "run_analysis.R" script. The output can be written out by using 'write.table(summarizedData, "output.txt")'

The Codebook explains the data and the transformations in more depth.
